<h1>Message to someone Special 🤍</h1>(tap for song)

<br>
<br>
<h2>Hi Garima ji,</h2><br><br>
<p>    Wish you Happy New Year 2026😊😊 as this year Started with you and I wanna say 2025 was best year of my life as I randomly met with you on snapchat and all thanks goes to Snapchat owners and You cause you reponded me so calmly.<br><br>
I don’t know when it started,<br>
but somewhere in between the small talks,<br>
you became a calm part of my day.
</p>

<p>
I’m not very expressive by nature.<br>
I usually keep feelings to myself,<br>
but this page is my quiet way of saying something real.
</p>

<p>
Your voice, your way of talking,<br>
even simple conversations —<br>
they stay with me longer than expected.
</p>

<p>
I don’t want anything from you.<br>
No pressure, no expectations.<br>
Just honesty — and a little warmth 🤍
</p>

<p>



See, kehna to bahut kuch chahta hun par emotion ko express karna nahi aata, I don't know why par jo hai so hai Dheere-Dheere sab bol dunga
 once i spent some more time with you.
Aur mujhe lagta hai bolne s jada karna jada sahi hai as action speaks louder and clear more then words. Bolne ko to kuch bhi bol sakta hai
ye kar dunga vo kardunga but i think that's not worthy.<br><br>

I am very simple person you ever met in your life not to hi-fi and show off type with fake expressions and living in fake world and creating
 fake aura and i know girls are more attracted towards them cause they look cool dude and after that they regret.
I am not too handsome may be not too good looking as per me änd i don't know your view😅 but i think 
internal beauty matter alot how you think and give respect to others and trust me i respect you a lot and care you too.<br><br>

See, I don't know what world think about relationship and all but in my context you if you are emotionally connected with someone you will 
always be there to support them in any situation and no commitment is required over there as commitment is like a bond that jise na chahte
 huye log pura karne ko majboor hote h and jinko nahi karna hota h vo vaise bhi nahi karte and jo true love hota hai use koi commitment ki jarurat 
  nahi hoti hai uske liye to admi jaan bhi de deta hai. 
 So I believe in true love rather then using person for personal desires.
If any person is loyal to me literally and love and care me mai uske liye sab kuch kar sakta hun even i can sacrifice myself if required.<br><br>

I don't know what you think about me and but i feel deeply connected with you and i don't mind how you look. Mai to bas true and unconditional love
  me believe karta hun jisme trust and loyalty ho, haan aap commitment mere s 
lelo i am ready to give whatever commitment you want and i know jb apko koi pasand aa jaye to vaha
  koi commitment ki jarurat nahi padti. first mai to yahi kahunga Pehle mujhe aap acche se samajhlo mai kaisa hun apke layak hun ki nahi 
  then jo apko sahi lage. it's about your choice. kyunki mai jhut bolke trust build nahi karna chahta aap khud se judge karo, once you get 
  satisfied by yourself.
<br><br>
See, I know every girls got multiple proposal(attentions) from multiple people all knows but think twice as choose those who really care 
about you cause as year spend no one is there only that person will care you who is having real feeling for you and you have to judge this 
as anyone really care about you and never take you as for granted in any situation and rest are for the time pass showing fake care and love.<br><br>

Main perfect nahi hoon. Kabhi zyada soch leta hoon, kabhi emotions express karne mein late ho jata hoon. Par ek baat hamesha clear hai 
— you are important  for me and i am quit addicted too. I like the way you laugh, speak and explain everything, i found a innocence in that.
Mai bas apko filhal trust hi dila sakta hun ki mai sabki tarah nahi i'm  quit different in terms of thinking, I believe in loyalty, trustworthiness and be
<b>GENTLEMAN</b>. I am always there for you in any situation. I wanna show you how much i think about you care about you but not able to explain😢.
Dheere Dheere aap bhi  mujhe samajhne lagoge once you also  get connected with me and understand that how much GENTLEMAN i am.<br><br>

Yaar! mai kya bolun samjho na feeling ko meri mai explain bhi nahi karpata 😭 na 
likh kar na bol kar. bolna kuch chahta hun bol kuch deta hun aur vahi fas jata hun😭. Mai jada explain karne ke karan hi fasta hun aur main point 
jo bolne chahta tha vo  bol nahi pata keh sakte hai mai nervous ho jata hun apne aap ko explain karne me.
i just wanna spent some time and share my feelings bas, meri koi bhi galat intentions nahi hai, bas yahi trust dilana chahta hun ki aap mere saath 
safe and comfortable feel karo thats it.
